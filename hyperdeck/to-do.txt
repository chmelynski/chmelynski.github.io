# map
uint32 array - index into arc start
float32 array - lng,lat
float32 array - x,y

fetch states for a nice default map?
or how about a world map with a default orthographic projection, and default code to make it spin
select box for projection - need to fetch d3 projection code


# in general, fetching needed code upon loading of a cell type is a good idea - could load threejs on load of graphics cell
in afterLoad: if (!THREE) { load script src="three.js" }


# diagram
point queue
label points by letter
store letter label in a Point -> label dict, buttons generate function call with those labels as args

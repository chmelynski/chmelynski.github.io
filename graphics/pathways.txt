restricting attention to the browser, 4 aspects need to function properly:

duf import
duf export
render to device
denovo creation


graphics.ts/.js - DAZ support, but nothing to do with theme
daz.js - theme stuff - must support both browser and node
studio.js - node driver
studio.htm - browser driver

duf.htm and uvmapper.htm need to be rolled into studio.htm

well, maybe not.  studio.htm should be a very general-purpose setup
maybe if we generate UI with js, then we can have only studio.htm and just load whatever ui we need

the core purpose of studio.htm is asset management - uploading and downloading assets
this is what studio.js (the node driver) doesn't need to worry about
